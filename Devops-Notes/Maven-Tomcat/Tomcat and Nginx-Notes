# What is Tomcat Server
Apache tomcat is a webserver
Apache tomcat is used to run the java application
Apache tomact is free and open source
Apache tomact run on port no 8080 by default

Apache tomact folder structure 
bin -> This is folder is use for start the tomcat application [sudo sh startup.sh, sudo sh shutdown.sh]
conf -> In this folder we have two important files one is server.xml to see the port number
        and second file is tomact-user.xml to configure the user names and passwords
lib -> It contains libraies (jars)
logs -> It contains server logs
tmp -> It contains temporary files
webapps -> It contains deployment files and war files

# How to install tomact server
First we have to install java
sudo yum update
sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
sudo dnf install java-11-amazon-corretto -y
java --version
which java
whereis java
yum list installed | grep java
ls -al /usr/bin/java
ls -al /etc/alternatives/java  --> To see the java path

you will get link by apache tomcat
sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.91/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.91.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.82.tar.gz
cd apache-tomcat-9.0.80
cd /bin
sudo sh startup.sh
sudo vi webapps/manager/META_INFA/contex.xml      
	allow ".*"                          
cd /conf                                            
sudo vi tomcat-user.xml
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomact" roles="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>

After instilation you will login your tomcat using your public Ip and port Number
After login upload your war file manually and deploy

-> /usr/share/tomcat-version/webapps  -> Tomcat root directory.


# What is Nginx
NGINX (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance, open-source web server that can also be used as:

NGINX can act as:
-> Web Server (serves static content very efficiently)
-> Reverse Proxy (forwards client requests to backend servers)
-> Load Balancer (distributes traffic across multiple servers)
-> Forward Proxy (client-side proxy)
-> API Gateway (manages and routes API calls)
-> Caching Server
-> SSL/TLS Termination Proxy


✅ Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy sits in front of your backend servers.
It receives client requests first, then forwards them to internal servers without exposing your backend directly.
It Act as a behalf of server

Why it’s used:
-> Protects backend servers (hides internal IPs)
-> Load distribution across multiple servers
-> Caching, SSL termination, rate limiting, security filtering
		Example tools: Nginx, HAProxy, Apache, Traefik



✅ Load Balancer
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure:
	High availability
	Fault tolerance
	Better performance

Types:
L4 Load balancer (TCP/UDP)
L7 Load balancer (HTTP/HTTPS – works like reverse proxy)
Example: AWS ALB / NLB, HAProxy, Nginx


🔵 L4 Load Balancer (Layer 4 — Transport Layer)
Works at: TCP/UDP level
Understands: IP address + Port only
Does NOT understand: HTTP URL, headers, cookies, methods

How it routes traffic:
Based on source IP, destination IP, port
Blindly forwards packets to a backend server

Use cases:
High-performance TCP/UDP traffic
Gaming servers, streaming, database proxies
Environments where simple, fast routing is needed
Example: AWS NLB, HAProxy (L4 mode)


🔵 L7 Load Balancer (Layer 7 — Application Layer)
Works at: HTTP/HTTPS level
Understands:
URL path (e.g., /login, /products)
HTTP headers
Cookies
Methods (GET, POST, etc.)

How it routes traffic:
Content-based routing (e.g., /api to service A, /auth to service B)
Can modify requests and responses
Can do SSL termination, caching, authentication

Use cases:
Microservices
APIs
Websites & web apps
Anything requiring smart routing
Example: AWS ALB, Nginx, Traefik


✅ Forward Proxy
A forward proxy is used on the client-side.
Clients connect to the proxy, and the proxy forwards the request to the internet on behalf of the client.

Why it’s used:
-> To hide client identity (IP masking)
-> To block/allow specific sites (corporate networks)
-> Caching frequently accessed sites
	Example: Squid Proxy, corporate proxy

✅ API Gateway
An API gateway manages and controls access to microservices.

What it does:
-> Request routing
-> Authentication & authorization
-> Rate limiting
-> Logging and monitoring
-> Aggregating multiple microservice calls into one response
	Examples: AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee, Nginx API Gateway


✅ Reverse Proxy vs Load Balancer — Why Both?
🔵 1. Reverse Proxy = Security + Control
A reverse proxy mainly provides:
Security (hiding backend IPs)
SSL termination
Caching
Filtering / WAF
Traffic inspection
Forward requests to your application server

👉 It can forward traffic to one backend server or multiple, but that's not its primary job.

Purpose:
➡️ Protect backend + enhance features


🔵 2. Load Balancer = High Availability + Distribution
A load balancer is specifically built for:
Distributing traffic evenly across many servers
Avoiding overload
Detecting unhealthy servers
Failover if one server dies
Auto-scaling support

Purpose:
➡️ Spread load across multiple servers to avoid downtime

⭐ Why reverse proxy is NOT enough?
If you use only a reverse proxy and have multiple backend servers:

❌ Reverse proxy does NOT:
continuously check if servers are healthy
automatically remove failed servers
ensure equal traffic distribution
support millions of concurrent connections efficiently (L4/NLB scale)
integrate with cloud auto-scaling
A load balancer is optimized for this.


How to install Nginx
sudo yum update
sudo yum install nginx
sudo service nginx start
sudo chkconfig nginx on
sudo service nginx status

sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  --> To see the nginx port number
sudo vi /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html  --> To see index.html regarding nginx

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf     -> To change the HTTPD port number.

After instiling the nginx you will paste your public Ip along with portnumber 80 



# How to install HTTPD in Ubuntu
-> sudo apt-get update
-> sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
-> sudo systemctl status apache2
-> cd /var/www/html


What is the differnece between SSL and TLS
# SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
SSL is an old security protocol used to encrypt data between a client and server.
Created in the 1990s by Netscape.
Versions: SSL 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0
Now outdated and insecure. (All versions are deprecated)
👉 Today browsers no longer support SSL.

# TLS (Transport Layer Security)
TLS is the modern, secure version that replaced SSL.
More secure, faster, and widely used today.
Versions: TLS 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 (latest and fastest)

👉 When we say “SSL certificate”, we actually mean TLS certificate — names are used interchangeably, but the protocol used is TLS.

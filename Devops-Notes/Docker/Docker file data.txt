# How to create Docker file 
We will install tomcat on centos
what steps we want to run the tomcat server
1) Pull the centos from docker hub            FROM
2) change the dir cd /opt                     WORKDIR
3) Install java                               RUN
4) Download the tomcat from website           RUN or ADD
5) extract the file                           RUN
6) Tell docker that it runs on port 8080      EXPOSE
7) start the tomcat service                   CMD [it will run in runtime]

FROM amazonlinux:latest
WORKDIR cd /opt
RUN yum install java-11-amazon-corretto -y
ADD https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.80/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.80.tar.gz.asc . [Suppose if you use run wget Url]
RUN tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.80.tar.gz.asc
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.80/bin/catalina.sh", "run"]    [catalina.sh is available in bin folder]

If you want to write dockerfile manually you will write like above

# how to create some normal dockerfiles
FROM amazonlinux:latest
RUN mkdir dockerdata
RUN echo "hello what are you doing" > /dockerdata/file1
ENV name manoj > /dockerdata
RUN touch file2

FROM amazonlinux:latest
VOLUME ["/name1"]
WORKDIR name1
RUN manoj1

# Build the application using Vite
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the application
# Use an official Nginx image to serve the built app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build folder from the build stage into Nginx's public directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port the app will run on

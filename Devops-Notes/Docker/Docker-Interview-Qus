# What is Docker?

# How containers are different from virtual machines
-> Containers are light weight operating system.
-> Containers it doesn't have full operating system. it has base operating system.
-> Containers having shared libries
-> Virtual machine having full operating system. it having system libries

# What is Docker lifecycle
-> First we should create the dockerfile set of instructions that defines docker file
-> thenafter we have to create the docker images with the help of docker build command [docker build -t imagename .]
-> Later we should create the docker container using that image with the help docker container command [docker run -d containername -p hostip:conatinerip imagename]

# What are the different docker components
Client
-> docker build 
-> docker pull
-> docker run

Host
-> images
-> containers
-> daemon

Registry
-> Docker hub

# What is the difference between docker ADD and docker COPY
-> Docker ADD [Copy the files from URL]
-> Docker COPY [Copy the files from host system into containers]

# What is the difference between CMD and EntryPoint
-> When we are using CMD we can override the arguments
-> When we are using Entrypoint we can't override the arguments

# What are the networking types in docker what is default network
-> Default network is bridge network
-> Types of networks are
   Bridge
   Host
   None
   overlay
   Macvaln

# Can you explain how to isolated network between containers
-> When you create the container with custom network then you will go into isolated state

# What is the multi stage build in docker
A multi-stage build in Docker is a technique that allows you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile to separate build-time and run-time environments.
It helps you:
✅ Reduce image size
✅ Improve security (by not including build tools or secrets in final image)
✅ Separate concerns (build tools vs runtime environment)

# ---------- Stage 1: Build Stage ----------
FROM node:16 AS builder

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app code and build it
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# ---------- Stage 2: Production Stage ----------
FROM node:16-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Only copy the necessary files from the build stage
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/build ./build
COPY --from=builder /app/server.js ./server.js  # assuming server.js serves the React build

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the Node.js server
ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "start"]


# What are distro less images in docker
Distroless images are Docker images that do not include an operating system package manager or standard Linux distribution tools like:
bash
apt / yum
sh, curl, vi, etc.
-> It contain only the application and its runtime dependencies

# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Distroless runtime
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app .
CMD ["server.js"]

-> We use distroless images in production to minimize our container attack surface. Since they contain only the runtime, they’re much smaller and more secure than traditional images


# Real time challenges with docker
-> Docker is single daemon process. which can cause the single point of failure. if the docker daemon goes down for some reason all the application are down.
-> Container Networking Issues
      Port conflicts on the host
-> Large Image Sizes
      ⚠️ Problems: Slower build, push, and pull times
      🛠️ Solution: Use smaller base images like alpine or distroless
-> Security Vulnerabilities
      ⚠️ Problems: Using outdated base images
      🛠️ Solution: Use tools like Trivy, Docker Scout, or Clair to scan images
-> Persistent Data Handling
       ⚠️ Problems: Containers are ephemeral — data is lost if not stored externally
       🛠️ Solution: Use Docker volumes or bind mounts correctly

# What stpes would you take to secure your container
-> Ensure that the networking configured properly. This is the one of the most comman reasons for security issues. If required configure custom network and assign them to isolated containers.
✅ Use official or trusted images from Docker Hub or verified registries.
✅ Use minimal base images like alpine or distroless to reduce attack surface.
✅ Scan images regularly for vulnerabilities using tools like:
Trivy
Docker Scout
Clair

# What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT
Use CMD when you want a default command that can be easily overridden.
Use ENTRYPOINT when you want a mandatory command that should always execute.
Use both when you want a fixed command (ENTRYPOINT) with a default argument (CMD) that users can modify.

#CMD Example
FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo", "Hello from CMD"]

-> docker run myimage   --> run the above image. Output give as like below
   Hello from CMD

Override CMD at runtime
docker run myimage echo "Hi Varma"   --> Override  Output give as like below
  Hi Varma

#ENTRYPOINT
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]

-> docker run myimage "Hello from ENTRYPOINT"    --> run the above image. Output give as like below
    Hello from ENTRYPOINT

Override it won't work
docker run myimage ls





# What would you do if a Docker container running an application suddenly stops or gets killed?
✅ Here's a Strong, Structured Answer You Can Give:

🧠 1. Check Container Status
First, I would check if the container has exited or failed:
docker ps -a
This shows all containers, including stopped ones. I look at the STATUS and EXIT CODE to understand what happened.

🔍 2. Check Container Logs
Next, I check the logs of the crashed container to understand the cause:
docker logs <container_id_or_name>
Common issues:
Application crashed due to an exception
Out of memory
Port binding error
Database or external service failure

⚠️ 3. Inspect the Container
I use docker inspect to check the container's config, restart policy, and environment variables:
docker inspect <container_id_or_name>
Look for:
Misconfigured volume or env vars
RestartPolicy
Entry point errors

📦 4. Check Resource Usage
Use docker stats or top to check if the container used too much CPU, memory, or hit OOM (Out Of Memory):
docker stats
dmesg | grep -i oom
If the container was killed by the system, it’s often due to memory exhaustion.

🔄 5. Restart the Container
Once the issue is identified and resolved, restart the container:
docker start <container_id_or_name>
If it’s a service in production, I may recreate it with fixed config:
docker rm <old_container>
docker run ...  # new run command with fixes

🔁 6. Ensure Restart Policy Is Set
To prevent future crashes from killing the app permanently, make sure the container has a restart policy:
docker run --restart unless-stopped ...
Options:
no (default)
always
on-failure
unless-stopped

🧪 7. Review Dockerfile or Compose Config
If the issue keeps recurring, I check:

CMD/ENTRYPOINT errors
App dependencies not available
Missing wait-for scripts for DB, etc.

🛠️ 8. Setup Monitoring & Alerts (Proactive)
To catch future crashes faster, I would:
Use Docker event monitoring
Integrate with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog
Setup alerts on container exits or high resource usage

🚀 Sample Interview-Ready Answer:
"If a container running my application suddenly crashes, the first thing I’d do is run docker ps -a to confirm its state and check the exit code. Then I’d inspect the logs using docker logs to identify why it failed. If it’s a memory or config issue, I’d inspect the container with docker inspect or check dmesg for OOM events. I’d fix the root cause, restart the container, and ensure it has a proper restart policy like --restart unless-stopped to avoid future downtime. In a production setup, I’d also make sure monitoring and alerting are in place to detect and respond to container crashes proactively." ✅

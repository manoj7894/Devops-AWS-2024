# What is linux
-> Linux is open source operating system it is reliable and secure than other. It is developed by linus torvalds.
-> It was launched at sep 17 1991.

# What is operating system 
-> It is established communication between software and hardware.

# What is the difference between Linux and windows
# Linux
-> We will installed linux with free license
-> In linux we have so many distributors. you can choose whichever you want (Ubuntu, redhat, centos etc)
-> It is more secure than windows because viruses cant easily break the kernal

# Windows
-> We should purchase the license to install windows
-> Not many customization options available
-> We need powerful antiviruses software to overcome the viruses problems

# Why we are use linux
-> It is open source os
-> It is secure
-> Free download anywhere
-> low cost

# Where we can use linux
-> Mostly we used in portable devices (Audio system and navigation)
-> Car wipers
-> Artifical intellegence
-> Machine learing

# How linux will functioning
-> user
-> shell
-> kernel
-> hardware

When anyuser enter the command using keyboard it will interact with shell. shell will detected the wheather command is valid
or not if it is valid it will interact with kernal. kernal will translate into binary language then hard will understand the binary language
after understand the binary language it will return back the result to shell. shell will display the result.

-> Shell:- Shell is interputed command, interface between user and kernal, Shell is the way to interact with operating system.
-> kernal:- It translate into binary language, interface between shell and hardware
-> Hardware: it will understand the binary language

# File types
-> - (normal files)
-> d (directory files)
-> c (Charactor files)
-> b (Block files)
-> l (Link files)
-> s (symbolic file)

# What is the difference between Hard link and softlink
# HardLink
-> ln existingfile newfile [To creating the file]
-> Hard link having same inode numbers
-> Data will available after the remove the orginal file
-> It is not allowed for directory
-> comparitively faster 

# Softlink
-> ln -s existingfile newfile [To creating the file]
-> Soft link having different inode numbers
-> Data will not available after the remove the orginal file
-> It is allowed for directory
-> comparitively slow

# You will have another command to find the files
sudo yum install mlocate
after install you have to update your data base so that you have to execute below command to update database
sudo updatedb  --> To update database
locate filename  --> To find files
which echo  -->  It give the path of the command

# we have to use below command before use whatis
sudo mandb  --> To update database
whatis ls --> To see that command properties

# What is vim
-> vim stands for improved version of vi text editor

# Vim Has Multiple Modes.
1. 📝 Normal Mode (default after opening a file)
      -> Used for navigation, copying, pasting, deleting, searching, etc.
      -> You cannot insert text in this mode.
      -> Press Esc to return to Normal Mode from any other mode.

      📌 Examples:
         dd – delete a line
         yy – copy a line
         p – paste below
         u – undo
         U - Undo all changes on the current line since you entered it
         gg - It will place the cursor starting
         G - It will place the cursor end of the line
         w - It will shift the cursor word by word inforword direction
      

2. ⌨️ Insert Mode
      Used to insert or edit text.
      Enter this mode from Normal Mode by pressing:
      
      i – insert before cursor
      a – append after cursor
      o – open new line below the sentences
      O - open new line above the sentences
      
      
      Return to Normal Mode with Esc

3. 🔎 Visual Mode
      Used to select text.
      Enter from Normal Mode:
      
      v – character-wise selection
      V – line-wise selection
      Ctrl+v – block (column) selection
      
      After selecting, you can copy (y), delete (d), etc.

4. 🛠️ Command-Line Mode (also called Ex Mode)
Used to run vim commands like save, quit, search, or replace.
Enter it from Normal Mode by typing : (colon).

Example commands:
:w – write (save)
:q – quit
:wq – save and quit
:q! – force quit without saving
:/ -> To search the words
:s/hello/hi  -> To replace the word
:%s/hello/hi  -> To replace the all the words
: se nu  -> It giving the serial numbers
:4 -> it will place the cursor at 4th place
:X -> To set the password to the file
:X enter, enter -> To remove the passoword to the file



# User Management
-> We have three type of user in linux
-> root user -> It default start from 0
-> System user -> It default start from 1 to 999
-> Normal user -> It start from 1000 to 60000

# What are the properties in user
1) username  2) password 3) UID 4) GID 5) comments  6) directory 7) shell
UID -> it having only one user (user ID)
GI -> It having collection people (group ID)
-> root and system user it will come defaultly like above format
-> normal user
1) manoj  2) password  3) 1000-60000 4) 1000-60000 5) somewriting 6) /home 7) bin/bash

-> sudo useradd username   --> To create username
-> sudo passwd username    --> To create passwd to username
-> sudo userdel username   --> To delete the username
-> sudo passwd -d username --> To delete the passwd to user
-> sudo passwd -S username --> To see passwd status of user
      L → Locked
      P → Password set
      NP → No password
-> sudo usermod -l newuser olduser  --> To change the username
-> sudo usermod -u idnumber username  --> To change the userid number
-> sudo usermod -L username --> To lock the user   [If we lock the user. User could not able to login]
-> sudo usermod -U username --> To unlock the user
-> cat /etc/passwd  --> To see the user
-> sudo cat /etc/shadow  -->  To see passwds to the users
-> sudo chage -l username  --> It give the all data of passwd about user
-> sudo chage username   --> To change the existing passwd details.
-> sudo groupadd groupname --> To create the group
-> sudo gpasswd groupname  --> To create passwd to the group
-> sudo groupdel groupname  --> To delete group
-> sudo gpasswd -r groupname --> To delete passwd to group
-> sudo groupmod -n newname oldname --> To change the group name
-> sudo groupmod -g groudidnum groupname  --> To change the groupid
-> sudo useradd -G groupname username    --> To add new user to the group
-> sudo usermod -aG groupname username   --> To add user to the group
-> sudo gpasswd -d username groupname    -->  To delete user from group
-> groups username   --> Verify the user are added in group or not
-> cat /etc/group  --> To see the groups
-> sudo cat /etc/gshadow  --> To see the group passwd

# We have two types of groups 
-> primary group
-> secondary group

-> Primary group: Primary group will add automatically when we create the user                
-> Secondary group: Secondary group will not add automatically when we create the user. We should create seperately
-> we can assign 16 groups to user in linux. primary group would be within 16 groups. we can assign 15 groups to the user

# Permissions to the files and directories
-> sudo chmod 775 filename  --> To give permission to the files
read permission=4
write permission=2
execute permission=1
no permission=0
-> sudo chown username filename  --> To add user to the file  [If we want to remove the user to that file just we Change ownership of the file from one user to another use no option is the to delete] 
-> sudo chgrp groupname filename  --> To add group to the file 
-> sudo chown -R username filename  --> To add user to the directory
-> sudo chgrp -R groupname filename  --> To add group to the directory
-> sudo chmod u+s filename  --> To set the setuid permission to the file [Everyone will see the file]
-> sudo chmod u-s filename  --> To remove setuid permission to the file
-> sudo chmod g+s filename  --> To set the setgid permission to the file[only peoples who woule be in group they can only see]
-> sudo chmod g-s filename  --> To remove the setgid permission to the file
-> sudo chmod o+t filename  --> To set the sticky bit permission to the file[only file user can see]
-> sudo chmof o-t filename  --> To remove the stcky bit permission to the file

file having 666 permission and directory having 777 permission 
umask value is 022  (umask 022 it will come defaultly)
defaulty file will come 644 permission and directory will come 755 permission to add mask value

# umask temporary change
umask newvalue
umask 023

# umask permanent change
vi /etc/bashrc

-rwxrwxr-x
│ │  │  └─ Others (everyone else): r-x → can read and execute
│ │  └──── Group:                 rwx → can read, write, execute
│ └─────── Owner (user):          rwx → can read, write, execute
└───────── File type:             -   → regular file

# To assign ACL permission to the files and directory
setfacl is used to set Access Control Lists (ACLs) on files and directories, allowing more fine-grained permissions than traditional chmod.
This lets you give specific users or groups custom access to files, beyond owner/group/others.

-> setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename  -> To set user and permission to the file
-> setfacl -m g:groupname:rwx filename  -> To set group and permission to the file
-> setfacl -m o::rwx filename  -> To set other and permission to the file
-> setfacl -m u:username:rwx,g:groupname:rwx,o::rwx filename  -> To set user,group and other permission to file at a time
-> setfacl -Rm u:username:rwx directoryname  -> To set user and permission to the file
-> setfacl -Rm g:groupname:rwx directoryname  -> To set group and permission to the file
-> setfacl -x u:username:rwx filename  -> To delete the user acl permission to file
-> setfacl -x g:groupname:rwx filename  -> To delete the group acl permission to file
-> setfacl -b filename  -> To remove the all permission
-> getfacl filename   -> To check the ACL permission

# Booting Process
-> Bios
-> MBR
-> Grab
-> Kernal
-> init
-> Run levels

-> When we power on the system that all the devices is called Bios post process

-> Full Form: Basic Input Output System
-> It checks hardware: keyboard, RAM, hard disk — this is called POST (Power-On Self Test).
-> Then, it looks for a bootable disk where the OS (Linux) is installed.

-> Full Form: Master Boot Record
-> MBR is located in the first sector (512 bytes) of the bootable disk.
-> MBR loads and passes control to GRUB (or another bootloader).

-> Full Form: GRand Unified Bootloader
-> GRUB is responsible for Loading the selected OS kernel

-> Kernel initializes hardware drivers and mounts the root filesystem.
-> Then it starts the init system (like init or systemd).

-> Old systems used init (based on /etc/inittab)
-> Modern systems use systemd (based on targets)
-> Systemd replaces traditional runlevels with targets

| Runlevel | Command  | Description                                   |

# What is SCP and rsync
-> Both will copy the files from one remote server to another remote server
-> After make changes in local file if you try to copy 
-> SCP will copy the entire file
-> rsync will only copy the changes from one remote server to another remote server

-> Example of How to add cron jobs
🔧 How to Add the Cron Job
Open crontab:
crontab -e

Add your line (example):

* * * * * echo "Updated at $(date)" >> /home/user/manoj.txt

Save and exit (:wq for vi, Ctrl+O + Ctrl+X for nano)


| Command                 | What it does                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `crontab -e`            | Edit your cron jobs              |
| `crontab -l`            | List your current cron jobs      |
| `crontab -r`            | Remove your cron jobs            |
| `sudo crontab -e`       | Edit cron jobs for root user     |
| `systemctl status cron` | Check if cron service is running |


To schedule a cron job to run every 15 minutes, you can add the following line to your crontab file:

crontab -e

*/15 * * * * echo "Updated at $(date)" >> /home/user/manoj.txt

🔍 Explanation:
*/15  -> Every 15 minutes (0, 15, 30, 45)
*     -> Every hour
*     -> Every day of the month
*     -> Every month
*     -> Every day of the week


🕒 What does it mean?
This will run the command once every hour at 10 minutes past the hour.

✅ Example:
10 * * * * /home/ubuntu/script.sh

This will run at:
01:10
02:10
03:10
...
23:10

# What is Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that’s easy to read and write.
It’s widely used for:
Automation & scripting
Web development
Data analysis & AI/ML
DevOps & cloud automation
APIs, testing, and tooling

# What is Shell
Shell is executable file it contains multiple commands that executed one by one squently
Best for:
Running Linux commands
Simple automation
OS-level tasks

Limitations of shell:
Hard to manage large logic
Poor error handling
Difficult to write complex programs
Not portable across systems

# Why python is needed
Python is needed when automation becomes complex or scalable.
Works everywhere
Linux, Windows, macOS
Same script works across environments

Shell scripts are mostly Linux/Unix-only.

# Indentation:
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.
Consistent use of indentation is crucial as it indicates the
scope of loops, functions, and other constructs.


# Comments
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Types of Comment Lines
1. Single Line Comment ( # )
Example:
# This is a single-line comment

2. Multi Line Comment ( Triple quotes - """ )
Example:
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""


# What is Variables
-> Variable are containers for storing the data values
-> we use varibales make our deployment more dynamic
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
• A variable name cannot start with a number
• A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
• Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
different variables)
• A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Example
Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

Example
Illegal variable names:
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"


# Multi Words Variable Names 
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read. 
There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

-> Camel Case
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"

-> Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"

-> Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"


# Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even
change type after they have been set.

Example
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)


# Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type () function.

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


Single or Double Quotes?
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

Example
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'

Case-Sensitive
Variable names are case-sensitive.

Example
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
This will create two variables


# Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

Example
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or
else you will get an error.

# One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

Example
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# What is Cloud
-> Cloud (short for cloud computing) means using the internet to store, manage, and process data — instead of using your local computer or on-premise servers.
-> The cloud is like renting computing power, storage, or services from a data center managed by someone else (like AWS, Google Cloud, oracle, or Microsoft Azure).

-> All the above Cloud services that allow businesses to build, run and manage the wide range of applications and workloads in a highly format, secure and scalable environment.

-> These services are categorized into three parts
| Category                               | Description                              | Examples                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Rent virtual machines, storage, networks | AWS EC2, Azure VM                 |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)       | Deploy apps without managing servers     | AWS App Runner, Google App Engine |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service)       | Use ready-made apps online               | Gmail, Zoom, Salesforce           |


# What is a Region?
-> A region is a geographical area — like Asia Pacific (Mumbai) — where AWS hosts its cloud infrastructure.
Each region is completely independent, with its own:
Power, cooling, and networking
-> Each region having one or more Availability Zones (AZs)
-> Each AZ represents a separate data center (or cluster of data centers) within the same region.

# What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?
Each Availability Zone is an isolated data center (or multiple data centers) with:
Independent power and cooling.
High-speed private fiber connections between AZs (low latency).
Physical separation (usually 10–50 km apart) within the same region.


# What are AWS Edge Locations?
-> Edge Locations are AWS data centers located closer to end-users than the main regions.
-> Edge location are CDN endpoint of cloud front to deliver the content to end user with low latency.


📍 In India, AWS has multiple edge locations, for example:
Mumbai
Chennai
Hyderabad
New Delhi
Bengaluru
Kolkata

-> When someone in India accesses your app, CloudFront automatically serves the content from the nearest edge location — instead of always reaching your main AWS region (e.g., ap-south-1 in Mumbai).

-> Dedicated - here cpu storage all dedicated to one instance only
-> saving Paln  (it will give 72% discount)

# What are the types of volumes for ec2 instance
-> Instance store volume
-> EBS 

# When i try to launch an ec2 instance i am getting service limit exceed how to fix the issue
-> By default AWS offer service limit of 20 running instances per region, to fix the issue we need to contact AWS support to increase the limit based on requirment

# You have launched linux instance in AWS ec2. While configuration security group, you have selected SSH, HTTP, HTTPS protocol. Why do we need to select SSH
-> To verify that there is rule to allow the traffic from ec2 instance to your computer


# What is Elastic load balancer
-> Elastic load Balancer automatically divert the incoming traffic into multiple targets like Ec2, containers, Ip address.

# What are the types of load balancer in AWS
-> Classic load balancer
-> Application load balancer
-> Network load balancer [it used for transport layer, it work under TCP and UDP]
-> Gateway load balancer [it is used for security purpose]



# What is the difference between classic load balancer and application balancer
⚙️ Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
Older generation load balancer (before ALB and NLB).
Works at Layer 4 (Transport) and Layer 7 (Application).
Supports one listener per load balancer, meaning it listens on one port (e.g., port 80 or 443) and forwards requests to backend instances on a fixed port.
You can’t do advanced routing like based on URL path or hostname.

✅ Example:
You have 3 EC2 instances running a web app on port 80.
CLB listens on port 80 → sends traffic evenly to all 3 EC2 instances.

⚙️ Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Modern load balancer (recommended for web apps and microservices).
Works at Layer 7 (Application Layer).
Supports multiple listeners and ports (for example, HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443).
Supports dynamic port mapping — especially useful for ECS or container-based apps, where each container might run on a different port.
Can route traffic intelligently using path-based or host-based rules.

✅ Example:
Your ECS service runs multiple containers:
Container 1 → port 32768
Container 2 → port 32769
The ALB automatically maps incoming requests to whichever port your containers are using (this is dynamic port mapping).



-> Classic Load Balancer (CLB) supports a single listener per port and does not support dynamic port mapping.
-> Application Load Balancer (ALB) supports multiple listeners and ports, and allows dynamic port mapping for containers or services that use different ports — ideal for ECS or microservice architectures.



⚙️ Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Designed for high-performance, low-latency applications.
Works at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) — handles TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.
Can process millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latency.
Supports static IP addresses and even Elastic IPs (EIPs) for predictable networking.
Best suited for use cases where performance, static IP, or handling non-HTTP(S) traffic matters.

✅ Example:
You’re running a high-performance financial trading app or game server that uses TCP on port 443.
NLB listens on port 443 → forwards requests directly to backend EC2 instances or containers (without modifying packets).
It maintains client IP visibility, so the backend knows the original source IP.

⚙️ Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)
Specialized load balancer for network appliances like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or deep packet inspection (DPI).
Works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) and Layer 4 (Transport Layer).
Combines a transparent network gateway with a load balancer — meaning traffic passes through it without needing app-level changes.
It distributes traffic across multiple virtual appliances while preserving the source and destination IPs.

✅ Example:
You have 3 virtual firewall appliances running in EC2.
GLB receives traffic → automatically distributes it across the 3 firewalls → sends filtered/inspected traffic to your backend app servers.
This setup scales your network security layer automatically without reconfiguring routing

# Is it possible to reduce a EBS volume (Just read to get ne idea)
Yes, it is possible to reduce the size of an EBS volume in AWS, but with some limitations and considerations.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

1. For General Purpose SSD (gp3) and other EBS types:
Directly reducing the size of an EBS volume is not supported directly in AWS.
However, you can shrink the file system and then create a snapshot and restore the snapshot to a new, smaller volume.
Steps to reduce the size of an EBS volume:
Backup: Take a snapshot of the existing volume to prevent data loss.
Shrink the file system:
Log into your EC2 instance and reduce the file system size to fit within the desired new volume size.
For example, if you're using ext4 or xfs, you can resize the file system using commands like resize2fs for ext4.
Create a new volume: After shrinking the file system, create a new EBS volume with the desired smaller size.
Copy data: Mount the new volume and copy the data from the old (larger) volume to the new (smaller) one.
Detach the old volume: Once you’ve confirmed everything is working properly on the new volume, you can detach the old volume.
2. Elastic Block Store Snapshots:
AWS allows you to take snapshots of volumes. When reducing the size of a volume, this snapshot is typically useful as a backup or to restore data if necessary.
Limitations and Considerations:
Data loss risk: If the volume is not properly resized before transferring data, you risk losing data that exceeds the new smaller volume's capacity.
Downtime: There may be some downtime during the resizing process since you will need to detach the old volume and attach the new one.
Volume type: This process is applicable to most volume types, but the exact steps may vary depending on the file system used and the operating system of your EC2 instance.
Alternative - Elastic File System (EFS):
If your use case involves frequent resizing and dynamic scaling, consider using Amazon EFS, which automatically scales up and down, eliminating the need to manually adjust volume sizes. However, EFS is not suitable for all workloads, especially those requiring block-level storage.

In summary, while direct reduction of EBS volume size isn’t supported, the process of resizing can be achieved with a workaround involving shrinking the file system, creating a new volume, and transferring the data.



# I need modify the ebs volume in linux and windows is it possible
-> yes its possible from console use modify the volumes in section give size u need
-> In windows go to disk management for linux mount it to achive the modification

#  You have an Ec2 instance that has an unencrypted volume. You want to create another encrypted volume from this unencrypted volume. Which of the following steps can achive this
-> Create one snapchat of unencrypted volume and copy the snapchat and create volume from that copied snapchat

# What is Amazon EBS-Optimized instance
-> This optimization provides dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS, which ensures that EBS performance is predictable and consistent.
-> When you select the amazon EBS-Optimized for instance you will pay additonal hourly charge money for instance.

# What is EBS Snapshot
-> It can take backup on EBS volume. Snaphots are incremental backups
-> If this is your first snapshot it will take some time to create. snapshot are point in time of copies of volume.


# What is EFS
-> EFS is a elastic file system it is scalable and fully managed file storage service in provided by AWS.
-> EFS is provides a simple and elastic file system that can be mounted a mulitple Ec2 instances.
	Scalability: It is automatically scales your file system
	Performance: Efs provides the low-latency and high throughput file storage.
		     EFS is unlimited of Size
		     EFS is Costly


# What is the difference between Bloack storage and File storage
# Block Storage:- 
-> Block storage operates at lower level, raw storage device level and manage the data as a set of numbered and fixed size block
# File Storage:-
-> File Storage operates at higher level, the operating system level and manage the data as a name hierachy of files and folder

# Example:-
The key difference between block storage and file storage lies in how data is stored, accessed, and managed. Here's a breakdown of their characteristics and differences:

1. Block Storage
Data Structure: In block storage, data is stored in fixed-size blocks. These blocks are individual chunks of data that are addressed by their unique block addresses.
Access: Block storage operates at the lowest level of storage, and data is accessed at the block level. This means the storage system is agnostic to the data format and allows any application or operating system to use it.
Use Cases: Block storage is typically used for applications that require high-performance storage with low latency, such as databases, virtual machines, and operating system drives.
Examples:
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
AWS EC2 instances' storage
Hard drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) in computers or servers
Performance: Block storage is generally faster and offers better performance than file storage because it works at the raw data level.
2. File Storage
Data Structure: In file storage, data is organized and stored as files within directories, and it's usually accessed via a file system. It works in a hierarchical manner, where files are organized in folders or directories.
Access: File storage operates at the file level. It includes both the file and the metadata (like file name, permissions, etc.). You typically access it using protocols like NFS (Network File System), SMB (Server Message Block), or others.
Use Cases: File storage is used for applications that need shared access to files or require easy management of large amounts of data organized in directories, such as file sharing, media storage, backup systems, and collaborative applications.
Examples:
Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
Google Cloud Filestore
Network Attached Storage (NAS)
Performance: File storage may have slightly higher latency compared to block storage, as it needs to manage the file system overhead and metadata, but it is still well-suited for many shared use cases.

Conclusion:
Block storage is suitable for applications where performance, speed, and direct access to raw storage are critical, like databases or operating system disks.
File storage is best for managing and sharing files in a more user-friendly way with an organized file system structure. It's ideal for workloads like shared file systems or file backups.




# What is Auto Scaling
-> Autoscaling allows you to automatically scale up and scale down the number of instance depends on cpu utilization and memory utilization.
-> we have two types of autoscaling
  -> Horizontal Autoscaling  -> It will scaleup and scale down the instances
  -> Vertical Autoscaling  -> It will increase the CPU capacity.
-> we have two components in Autoscaling
  -> Auto scaling group
  -> Launch configuration

# What are the benifits of auto scaling
-> Better fault tolerance
-> Better availablity
-> Better cost management

# Where does the user specify the maximum number of instances with the auto scaling commands
-> Auto scaling lunch configuration

# What is AMI
-> AMI stands for Amazon machine image in aws. Its a template that contains a software configuration for virtual machine on amazon web service.

# What are shared AMI's
-> Shared AMI's are the AMI that are created by other developed and made available for other developed to use.

# Types of AMI'S
-> Published by AWS
-> AWS Marketplace
-> Generated from existing instance
-> Uploaded virtual server

# How to plan autoscaling
-> Manual Scaling
-> Dynamic Scaling
-> Scheduled Scaling





# What is EIP
-> EIP stands for elastic IP address in AWS. It is designed for dynamic cloud computing.
-> When you want to have static IP address for your instance when you stop and restart your instance. you will use EIP address.

# By default how many elastic ip address does AWS offer
-> 5

# What is the use of elastic ip are they charged by AWS
-> These are ipv4 address which used to connect the instance from internet. they are charged if the instance are not attached it.

# What is static IP
-> It is a constant and perment IP it wil never change when you stop and restart the instance

# What is Dynamic Ip
-> Ip will change whenever you stop and restart the instance.

# What Ip
-> IP stands for internet protocal. It will communicate the data from one system to another system
-> We have two types of IP address
   -> Ipv4
   -> Ipv6

# What is Ipv4 [Internet protocal version 4]
-> it having 32 bits
-> Ipv4 having public and private Ip

# What is Ipv6 [Internet protocal version 6]
-> it having 128 bits
-> Ipv4 having only public Ip

Note: one IP having 4 octet
      one octet having 8 bites
      one bytes having 8 bites

# What is subnet
-> Subnets are associated with route tables that control the traffic flow within the VPC. 
-> Public subnets typically have a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow internet access for resources within the subnet, while private subnets route traffic through NAT gateways.

# What is VPC
-> VPC stands for virtual private cloud in aws. 
-> It is virtual network in AWS
-> It allow you to control your vitual network environment.

Note: We can assign the ips using CIDR
      CIDR stands for Classes inter Domain Range.
# Ranges
  10.0.0.0/16  -> This is one ipv4 range
  this comes upto 65535 because above ip is ipv4 ip it have 32 bit and above ip range is 16
  32 -16       16
 2        ->  2     -> two power 16 is 65536 but we will take 65535
because 65536 it is allocated to broad casting it wont work in AWS network.

-> Highest range is 16 in VPC
-> Lowest range is 28 in VPC
   10.0.0.0/16  = 65536
                    32-32
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 0
                    32-31         1
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 1 = 2  = 2
                    32-30         2
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 2 = 2  = 4
                    32-29         3
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 3 = 2  = 8
                    32-28         4
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 2 = 2  = 16

-> If you have 8 even VPC dont allow that range
-> Mostly 16 and 24 ranges will be use in VPC.
   
# What is the difference between pubilc Ip and private Ip or subnets
-> Public Ip having internet access
-> Private Ip dont having internet access
-> Web servers will keep in public subnets 
-> DB server and secure data will keep in private subnet
-> Public subnet having internet gateway to allow the internet access within vpc
-> Private subnet having NAT gateway to take the data from private subnet.

# What is internet gateway
-> Internet gateway will provide the internet the access to the pubilc subnet
-> Internet gateway it will work like a two way traffic means like incoming and outgoing

# What is NAT Gateway
-> NAT stands for Network address Translator.
-> NAT gateway we will use to get the data from private subnet
-> NAT gateway it will work like a one way traffic means like outgoing

Note: When we are attach the NAT gateway to the private subnet it will work only outgoing traffic menas noone have change to enter into the subnet.

# What is the difference between NACL and SG
# NACL [Network access control list]
-> It will work upto subnet level
-> NACL will apply automatically when we create the resource
-> It is a stateless because we can give permission to inbound and outbound rule
-> We can attach only 1 NACL to subnet
-> We can create both allow and denied rules

# SG [Security Group]
-> It will work upto instance level
-> SG will select particularly
-> It is a statefull because when we give permission to inbound rule and it will automatically to outbound rule
-> We can attach the 5 security groups to subnet
-> We can create only allow rules

# How can you control the security to your VPC
-> you can use security group and NACL to control the security in VPC

# What are the Default services we get when we create custom AWS VPC
-> Route table
-> Security group
-> NACL

# By default how many Ip addredd does aws reserve in AWS
-> 5

# How can you convert the public subnet to private subnet
-> Remove IGW and add NAT Gateway 

# What is Security group
-> Security allow you to control the traffic based on port , protocal and source/destination
-> AWS allow you to control the traffic in and out of your instance through firewall is called security group

# You have chosen windows instance with classic and you want to make some changes to the security group. how will these changes be effective
-> Changes are automatically applied to windows instances


# What is VPC peering connection
-> VPC peering connection allows you to connect one vpc to another vpc. Instances in these vpc behave as if they are in same network.

# To establish the peering connection between two VPC what conditions must be met
-> CIDR block should not overlap between VPC setting up peering connection.
-> peering connection is allowed within a region, across region, across different account.

# what is VPC endpoint service
-> If we want to access our service in other AWS account with same VPC then we will use VPC Endpoint service

# We have three types of endpoints
-> Interface Endpoint  -> It will support 86 services
-> Gateway Endpoint  -> It will support only two service s3 and dynamoDB
-> Gateway load balancer endpoint

# What is the virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a VPC
-> Elastic network interface

# When attached to an amazon VPC which two compenents provide connectivity with external network
-> Internet gateway
-> Virtual private gateway

# What is NAT instance
-> NAT stands for Network address translation instance is an amazon linux machine image that is design to accept the traffic from instance within a private subnet.


# What is VPN
-> VPN Stands for Virtual private Network
-> It create the secure connection over the internet to protect the data exchanges between user and the network.
  # Example:- To connect the private network server by VPN from different region or account. 

-> https://youtu.be/OLi1mdBW_9Y?si=o0ID8GWowlVWxszn
-> https://youtu.be/lN7jFHRdwzA?si=-7RYIr3fBvZcjFbG

# What is the difference between VPC and VPN
The main difference between a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in AWS is that a VPC creates a private network within a public cloud, while a VPN provides secure access to those resources remotely:

Difference between VPC and VPN
1.   vpc is a virtual private cloud within public cloud 
2.  vpc is created by public cloud with private network environment 
3.  it' s easy data to securely transfer to a private environment . 
4 . Vpc is the networking part .

VPN is a virtual private  network.
VPN is a secure connection over the. internet protect data .

-> Roles are for AWS service, where we can assign permission of some aws service to other service
   ex:- Giving s3 permission to ec2 instance to access s3 bucker content
# Policy
-> Polices are for users and groups. where we can assign permission to user and groups
   ex: Giving permission to user to access to s3 bucket 

# What are the two types of access that you can provide when you creating the user
-> programmatic access
-> Console access

# I am viewing aws console but unable to launch the instance, i recive IAM error how can i rectify it
-> I need to give ec2 permission to that IAM user

# I dont want my AWS account id to be exposed to users how can i avoid it
